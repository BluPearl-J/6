A = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}
B = {1, 4, 16, 64, 256}
#output  # {1,2,4,8,16,64,256}
answer Operator is Union
A | B  
# Combines all unique elements



NUMBER 2
{1, 2, 4, 8, 16} *** {1, 4, 16, 64, 256}  #Output {1,4,16}
#ANSWER NTERSECTION
A & B  # Common elements of both sets



NUMBER 3
{1, 2, 4, 8, 16} *** {1, 4, 16, 64, 256}  # Output {2,8}
#ANSWER ELEMENTS IN SET A NOT IN SET B.
#OPERATOR DIFFERENCE
ANSWER A-B

NUMBER 4
 {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} *** {1, 4, 16, 64, 256}  # {2,8,64,256}
 #ANSWER ELEMNETYS IN SET B OR  IN SET A NOT BOTH.  REMAINDER ELEMENTS AFTER INTERSECTION
 #SYMMETRIC DIFFERNECE
 ANSWER A ^ B  # Elements in either A or B but not both



 NUMBER 5

 e) {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} *** {1, 4, 16, 64, 256}  # False

# Checking if  A is improper subset of B
 i.e is  A a subset of B but not equal to B.


A < B  # True if A is a proper subset of B
